### 1.2 Dependency order

Implementation should follow this dependency chain:

Authentication -> Organizations -> Restaurants -> Branches -> Users -> Roles -> Menus -> Inventory -> Orders -> Kitchen -> Payments -> Delivery -> CRM -> Marketing -> Analytics -> AI

Rules:

- A lower-level domain must not depend directly on a later domain.
- Later domains can reference earlier domains by ID.
- Cross-domain side effects should use events, not direct calls where practical.
- Integration adapters must implement provider interfaces. Business logic must not depend on vendor-specific classes.
